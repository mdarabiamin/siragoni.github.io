Poster at LHCP 2020 (Large Hadron Collider Physics).
The venue should have been Paris, but Covid was of another opinion...
The poster described the most recent results on Ultraperipheral Collisions, which
included all of the ALICE Run 2 dataset, both pPb and Pb--Pb.
Here is a picture with all the available participants!
