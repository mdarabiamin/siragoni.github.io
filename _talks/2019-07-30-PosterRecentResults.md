Poster at INPC 2019 (International Nuclear Physics Conference), the biggest conference of its kind.
The venue was Glasgow, which led to the tasty haggis opportunity...
The poster described the most recent results on Ultraperipheral Collisions, which 
included all of the ALICE Run 2 dataset.
This increased the precision of our results a lot compared to the Run 1 experience!
