Outreach session with high school students.
An undefeatable team of three people joined forces to help these students getting acclimated with the CERN environment!
[Sabino Zagaria](https://www.facebook.com/sabino.zagaria), [Evelina Durastanti](https://www.facebook.com/evelina.durastanti) and I, made a fool out of ourselves showing the engineering, administrative and physics sides of CERN. But what a great time.
Shame that the Covid outbreak started the following day in Italy...
