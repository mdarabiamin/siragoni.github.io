My first poster ever... Same topic as my mater thesis, from which it was pretty much taken. My supervisors at the time led me to provide a little help to obtain the spectra of pions, kaons and protons in the (at the time) new Xe--Xe data, in order to ultimately derive the Blast-Wave parameters from it. My first international conference... Unforgettable!
