This C++ Jouney is actually dedicated to a professor of mine from University days, who actually
passed to better life a couple months ago. I owe to him all the start of my career. He taught 
me everything I needed to start coding, and to enjoy it too...! Thanks, professor.

The true journey starts from the next page. 
Hopefully it will be of help to all the readers!
