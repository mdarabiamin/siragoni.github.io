<!-- To my fellow human beings, -->

It certainly doesn't take a physics degree to see that these are troubled times. We may feel more alone than ever. We may feel more scared than ever. Our typical life is nowhere to be found anymore. I owe an apology for the highly unusual post from what I have always written, but as the uncertainty grows, I felt like I had to somehow step up for the community.

I feel like there is an opportunity also in these times where social life is not a given anymore. It is a time for families to bundle up together. I like to think that in these special times, communication inside the family may grow accordingly, strengthening those bonds that we have always taken for granted. It can be a time for parents to better know their children, to play all together at those old school board games that had somehow slipped away from our lives. It can also be the occasion to laugh, watch movies together, to rediscover something that we have forgotten, or that we simply didn't give enough relevance to.

My best wishes for a happy Sunday with you families.

<!-- If you live by yourself, due to work or studies, don't be afraid. It is easy to feel that loneliness. It can grip you from behind. But it is fine. It is understandable. However, it is also a time to recover another side of us which we had never paid enough attention to, due to work or the tran tran of our everyday lives. I like to think that routines may help in relieving our mental fatigue. You see, I have a routine for everything in my life. From exercising, to walking, hell, I even got a standard time for eating and sleeping! But this has helped me a lot since I was a kid... The side I was speaking of, actually has something to do with our childhood. It was a time where the ordinary and small events of our everyday life were enough to move us deep within. Gazing from a window and seeing dawn and dusk, a bird resting itself on a garden, the blooming of flowers, or the coming of a fresh snow in these very cold days (I am writing from Birmingham). Somehow it is easier to pay attention to these small details now that life seems to have slowed down a bit... -->
