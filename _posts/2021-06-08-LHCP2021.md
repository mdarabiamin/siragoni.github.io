I wanted to share with everyone my talk at LHCP 2021.
The title was "New measurements on diffractive vector mesons".
It was a joint ALICE and LHCb presentation.

The talk is available [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/905399/contributions/4291683/),
together with the corresponding recordings...


The new results from both collaborations were shown.
In particular, coherent vector meson production in peripheral collisions and coherent vector meson production associated with neutron emission are discussed.
In addition, the UPC potential for tetraquark searches is also discussed.
The conference proceedings will also be available in the near future.


As a reminder, the ALICE team at the University of Birmingham is involved in the analysis of UPC processes, jets (Jakub Kvapil), and strangeness production (Oliver Jevons), under the tutelage of our supervisors.
