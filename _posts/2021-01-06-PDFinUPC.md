Essentially, a UPC event, shown [here](https://siragoni.github.io/posts/2021/01/UltraperipheralCollisionsFeynmanDiagram/), probes the gluons inside the target. The whole thing is very complicated to explain, but basically, more or less just "counting" the *vector mesons* coming out of the interaction allows for a measurement of the required *gluon pdf*... Or at least, that is the aim actually. Huge advancements have been made in recent times. It really can be said that we are exploring the *energy frontier of photon colliders*! Good times to be alive.
