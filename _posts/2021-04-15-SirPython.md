Dear Readers, it has been a while. A contribution of mine on a possible way of modeling the trend of the pandemic appeared online roughly a month ago.

It is available [here](http://www.quotidianoapuano.net/la-rubrica-del-fisico-apuano-simone-ragoni-uniniziazione-alla-modellizzazione-dellandamento-del-covid-19-python/) and [here](https://www.ilsitodimassacarrara.it/content/132-un%E2%80%99iniziazione-alla-modellizzazione-dell%E2%80%99andamento-del-covid-19-con-python).

It is basically using a simple SIR model to predict and describe the trend in a time-dependent way. The Python notebook which I had prepared for the public is also available on my GitHub, have a look [here](https://github.com/siragoni/Miscellaneous/blob/main/SimplifiedSIR.ipynb). Enjoy.
