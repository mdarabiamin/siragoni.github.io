A couple days ago, an interview I had done earlier in the month appeared on two websites. This is very flattering, and was extremely happy about reading it like I were not involved at all. It is in Italian, but Google should be able to translate it well enough.

It is available [here](http://www.quotidianoapuano.net/simone-ragoni-giovane-scienziato-apuano-birmingham-ginevra/) and [here](https://www.ilsitodimassacarrara.it/content/789-simone-ragoni-il-giovane-scienziato-apuano-tra-birmingham-e-ginevra), along with my trademark picture, which somehow appears everywhere (to be fully honest, I have only or two decent pictures of myself...).
