Hello again. Thanks for being so interested!

Last time we saw this:

We also said is that a photon interacts with a Pomeron from the target. Due to something weird called *conservation of the quantum numbers* (physicists love conserved quantities), we want an object with the same numbers.

The simplest thing that can come to mind is a *Vector Meson*, look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_meson). Do we see them? *Yes*.
