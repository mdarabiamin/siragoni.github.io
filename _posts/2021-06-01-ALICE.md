Quite recently, a new article I had written about ALICE and its mission, the Quark-Gluon Plasma, appeared on the usual two websites.
It is available [here](http://www.quotidianoapuano.net/la-rubrica-del-fisico-apuano-simone-ragoni-alice-piu-bel-microscopio-big-bang/),
and [here](https://www.ilsitodimassacarrara.it//content/656-alice-il-pi√π-bel-microscopio-il-big-bang).

Happy reading!
