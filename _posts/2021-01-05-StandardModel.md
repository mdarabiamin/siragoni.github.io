There is a similar concept in particle physics.
It is the [parton distribution function](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Introduction_to_Parton_Distribution_Functions).

I am taking the following picture from Wikipedia:

        @misc{ wiki:xxx,
          author = "{Wikipedia contributors}",
          title = "Standard Model --- {Wikipedia}{,} The Free Encyclopedia",
          year = "2021",
          url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Standard_Model&oldid=1001081091",
          note = "[Online; accessed 24-January-2021]"
        }

Basically, this shows all the known elementary particles up to now. It is these *bricks* that make up all the matter that surrounds us. *Actually*, this is also not true. All that surrounds is can be surmised mostly to *up*, *down* and *gluons*! This can also be shown thanks to the parton distribution functions. The only mystery at the moment is to understand the behaviour of the *gluon pdf*, and this is one reason why we are studying UPC events...
