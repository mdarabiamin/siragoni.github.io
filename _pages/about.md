Dear Reader,
thanks for getting here.

My name is Simone, and I am a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am one of the physicists of the [ALICE Collaboration](http://alice.web.cern.ch). The aim of this website is to try and help the community with a bit of the Physics that ALICE is involved with, and to try and explain my little role in it.

My PhD research is all about [Ultraperipheral Collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0502005). Ultraperipheral collisions, in short UPC, are a special class of events which may happen inside the CERN's Large Hadron Collider. A photon (what light is made of) is emitted from either interaction partners and interacts with an object known as Pomeron from the target (the other interaction partner). I am also helping the team I am part of via other means, e.g. not too complex VHDL projects and testing our hardware.

If you are more curious, please have a look at this website, I would like to keep it as simple as it can get and for any questions, feel free to mail me at [simone.ragoni.94@gmail.com](simone.ragoni.94@gmail.com)! ...And take a few seconds to admire the renowned symbol of the University of Birmingham, the Old Joe (a nice anecdote is that it is the source of inspiration for the tower of Isengard from the *Lord of the rings*)!
