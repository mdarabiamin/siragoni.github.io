Hello. My name is Simone, and I am a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am one of the physicists of the ALICE Collaboration, and if you are more interested in it, you can have a look [at this website](http://alice.web.cern.ch). I will explain a bit more about the Physics that ALICE is involved with, and my little role in it.
 
I am not learnt in web designing, so I have forked the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) prepared by the amazing Dr. [R. Stuart Geiger](https://stuartgeiger.com), towards whom I feel really grateful for having prepared such an amzing template!

For now, my idea is to keep this website as a mixture of posts about the C++ syntax and about the physics I am involved with. I was introduced by my PhD supervisors to the field I am studying, which is formally known as [Ultraperipheral Collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0502005), have a look at this link! This was possibly the first written documentation on it... If you are more curious, please have a look at this website (I will try to keep it very simple, even for me when I look at it later...!), and for any questions, feel free to mail me at simone.ragoni.94@gmail.com!
