Dear Reader,
thanks for getting here.

My research is all about [Ultraperipheral Collisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0502005). Ultraperipheral collisions, in short UPC, are a special class of events which may happen inside the CERN's Large Hadron Collider. A photon (what light is made of) is emitted from either interaction partners and interacts with an object known as Pomeron from the target (the other interaction partner). I am also helping the team I am part of via other means, e.g. not too complex VHDL projects and testing our hardware.

I am also a writer and a science communicator! My physics alter ego is *quarktastic* on Instagram. Tap that button! I am also author of *Become a particle physicist in eight simple moves* which was presented at the [24th IPPOG Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1185824/)! You can buy it [here](https://www.acrobatedizioni.it/prodotto/comediventarefisico/) in both Italian and English!

If you are more curious, please have a look at this website, I would like to keep it as simple as it can get and for any questions, feel free to mail me at [simone.ragoni.94@gmail.com](simone.ragoni.94@gmail.com)! ...
